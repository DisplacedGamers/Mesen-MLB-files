# Mesen-MLB-files
MLB files exported from the Debugger of Mesen 0.9.9

All RAM labels, ROM address labels, and comments I've added while reversing code when making videos for Displaced Gamers.
(Note: I should probably add checksum values for the games I used so the labels match in the event of different ROM revisions. Hmm.)

Funny thing about reversing - It is all just guessing until it is not.

You'll find stuff in here that is wrong.
You'll find stuff that is right.
Some comments and labels were written a long time ago.
Some comments and labels were written the day before I uploaded the file.

Half the labels might be "enemy" while the other half might be "entity" simply because I changed my mind at some point.

Understanding improves as you go. 

Treat these files as either a starting reference or for "cheating" during your own reversal endeavors. I treat them as a backup.
